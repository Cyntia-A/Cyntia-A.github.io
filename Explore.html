            The computing innovation I chose was the AI supercomputer, Watson. This AI computer
            is being used by many companies for many reasons. Companies use Watson for mainly
            healthcare, but also financial use, legal stuff, retail, and fantasy football.(4) It works by
            companies implementing apps made specifically for their company into Watson's data storage.
            Unlike any other type of computers, Watson also does not use the internet, but the data provided
            in its 'brain'.</p>

            My artifact explains what IBM Watson is. I used the program called Gimp to create my
            artifact. First, I went on the internet and googled images to put on my artifact. I then explained
            what Watson is and how it does not use the internet to search for an answer. </p>
        <p class = "Text">2C)
            Watson is a very innovative because of the many jobs it can perform much like regular
            people. Watson has been used as a chef, a dress designer, a movie director, and most
            importantly used in hospitals.(2) A few hospitals have benefited from using Watson as a way to
            help doctors find a disease quickly.
            A harmful effect to Watson is its probability of giving out the wrong information to the
            user. This impacts society because since it works for multiple companies, like hospitals for
            example, it can give off the wrong treatment for the patient. This can potentially put the patient
            in danger.</p>
        <p class = "Text">2D)
            Watson collects data about a patient's health and condition based on the health
            information that Apple provides from its HealthKit app. Doctors process the data Watson
            receives to create statistics and insights about the patients. Watson also responds better when
            it receives a patient that has a concussions because of Triax Technologies.(3) A data storage
            concern is that Watson may give off the wrong data. When used in Jeopardy, Watson would
            have 'high confidence' in an answer, but it would be incorrect.(1) Watson does not require the
            internet, but instead relies on the current information in its storage.(5)This requires the user to
            constantly update the data in it's storage. This could mean that Watson could be giving out
            outdated information to the companies.</p>
