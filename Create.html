            My program is written in javascript in Popcode, a development environment. 
            The purpose of my program is to have a bee fly towards the flower. 
            The bee would stay at the flower for a few seconds and then fly off the screen. 
            In this video, you can see the bee gliding towards the center, staying still for a few seconds and fly off the screen. 
            After it disappears from the screen, the process will repeat itself. </p>

             My partner and I used iterative pair programming by working on Glitch, a platform that enables coders to work on the coding page. 
             My partner and I worked on the basic code of the sunflower. 
             We created the code to make the petals, center, and the stem. 
             I wrote the code to animating the bee independently. 
             The first developmental challenge I encountered was to make the bee move away from the center after a certain time. 
             The reason why this happened was because the code created to move the bee was interfering with the if statement. 
             I solved this challenge by putting all of the animation code in if statements, so they do not interfere or overlap each other. 
             The second developmental challenge I encountered was to get the timer to correspond with my code. 
             At some point, when the timer reached the time given, the code would not run. 
             I had set the code to say if the timer is equal to 70, then move the bee. 
             This caused the bee to only move when the timer hit 70. 
             I solved this challenge by rewriting the code to say if the timer is greater than or equal to 70, then move the bee. 
             That way when the timer passes 70, it will continue moving.</p>

            <p>2c)
            	The main algorithm I use is the draw() function. 
            	In the draw() function, it includes code that creates the petals of the flower, the timer , and the bee gliding across the screen. 
            	The draw() function includes a logical algorithm like the code segment shown below:
            <div class = "Code">
              if (timer >= 70) {
              <br>
                 y = y - 5;
                 <br>
                 x = x - 5;
                 <br>
             }
             </div>
            <p>
            The purpose of this code segment is to allow the bee to continue gliding after it stops. 
            When the algorithm is working, this allows the bee to continue gliding after it stopped when the timer passes 70 seconds. 
            If this algorithm did not work, the bee would stay in the center of the canvas and not glide anymore.</p>
            <p>
            The draw() function also includes the math algorithm shown below: 
            </p>
            <div class = "Code">
             y = y - 5;
             <br>
             x = x - 5;
            </div>
            <p>
            The purpose of this code segment is allow the bee to move across the screen. 
            When the algorithm is working, the bee will move across the X and Y axis. 
            This is possible because the Y position is being subtracted by five which allows it to move on the Y axis. 
            It is possible to move across the screen instead of moving up because the X position is also being subtracted by five. 
            If this algorithm was not included, the bee would not be able to move at all.</p>

            <div class = "Code">
            function drawPetals() {
            <p>    for (let i = 0; i < petals; i++) {
                    <br>
                    fill(244, 244, 83);
                    <br>
                    rotate(24);
                    <br>
                    ellipse(15, 48, 20, 50);
                    <br>
                }
            </p>

            An example of an abstraction is my drawPetals() function. 
            The purpose of this function is to draw the petals around the origin. 
            I created the drawPetals() function to avoid repeating the same code over and over again.  
            Without this abstraction, I would have to code each petal manually instead of putting it in a loop.</p>
